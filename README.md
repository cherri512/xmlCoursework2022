# xmlCoursework2022
A repository containing work competed for assignments in LIS 542 - Information Structures Using XML in Spring of 2022.

Centered on utilizing XML for Digital Humanities projects for cultural heritage institutions, this course focused on data modeling and information structures using XML and related technologies, such as Oxygen XML Editor, XSLT, and others.  Included in this repository some of my personal assignments completed for course credit.
Materials edited for this course were often sourced from existing, known projects in the digital humanities.  For example, for a few of my assignments, I chose to edit XML files related to the Livingstone Online Project (see: https://livingstoneonline.org/).
